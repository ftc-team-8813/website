<h2>Our Outreach</h2>
<!-- The text below is probably not supposed to be a comment (TODO) -->
<!-- Welcome to the Outreach Section of The Winter Soldiers. Here, we will show some of
our impacts on the community and the world at large. -->
<p>We are devoted to making STEM education available worldwide through our numerous community outreach programs.</p>

<h4>India</h4>
<p> In the summer of 2018, a few members of our team traveled to Attapadi, Kerala, India to work with two FLL teams that we had started there previously.
We are proud to say that both teams made their way to the India national competition and did an amazing job.
<br></br>
While in India, we traveled to Hyderabad to meet the Kriyative Edge Academy and
talk to them about including FLL in their STEM program. We are excited to work with Kriyative Edge again soon.

<h4>FIRST Global</h4>
<p>We have worked with FIRST Global for the past several seasons; in 2017 we hosted Skype calls with teams from the Solomon Islands and Micronesia, and in 2018
we built a robot for Team Russia based on their designs after their robot kit was rejected in customs (afterward we shipped it to their competition in Mexico City).
<br></br>
In 2019, we continued to work with Solomon Islands and Russia and started a new relationship with teams North Macedonia and Somalia.
We are incredibly proud of Team Russia, which placed 42nd out of 189 teams and won the Clara Burton Award for Helping Hands.</p>

<h4>Alaska</h4>
<p>In 2019, we started a new connection with FIRST in Alaska, providing webinars on the topics of business planning and the design process.
Archives of both webinars can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYEtBEEOOwzwRSM2YUDOpEw">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Rock Island High School FTC</h4>
<p>Over the past several seasons, we started and mentored (twice a week) an FTC Team, #14832 Robotic Radiation, in Rock Island, Illinois.
We hope to continue supporting them through the COVID-19 pandemic if possible.</p>

<h4>Rock Island FLL</h4>
<p> Over the past few year, we've mentored two FLL teams at Skip-A-Long Daycare and Martin Luther King Jr. Center in Rock Island.
Initially, we hosted an FLL camp with students from both Skip-A-Long and the MLK Center. During this camp, we taught the students
both programming and project skills. Since then, we have met at both Skip-A-Long and MLK each week to help the students move along.</p>

<h4>MLK Center STEM Summer Camp</h4>
<p>In the summer of 2019, we hosted a six-week STEM-themed summer camp at Martin Luther King Jr. Center in Rock Island.
Meeting once or twice a week, we did a number of hardware-related activites before giving the campers an introduction to programming by setting them to program a servo-actuated
tilting marble maze with basic commands. The camp was a huge success and the marble maze proved itself a useful asset to show at demos.</p>

<h4>How to Learn and Use CAD (Webinar)</h4>
<p>As part of Team #9879 Root Negative One's Orange Banner webinar series, we hosted a 15-minute webinar on how to learn and use CAD.
An archive of the webinar can be found <a href="http://ftc9879.weebly.com/webinars.html">here</a> or on our FTC resources page</p>

<h4>COVID-19 Response</h4>
<p>As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we 3D-printed and hand-assembled 22 face shields
and donated them to a local Salvation Army outlet, where they were distributed to local first-responders.</p>
