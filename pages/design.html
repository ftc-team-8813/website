<h2>Robot Design</h2>
<p>For the Rover Ruckus challenge, we created a robot named Black Widow, which won Winning Alliance at the Rover Ruckus Super Qualifier in DeWitt, Iowa, advancing us to the State Championship.
At State, we were the 4th seed alliance captain, but we were defeated in the semi-finals due to a hardware malfunction. Despite this, we won Inspire Award, advancing us to the World Championship in Detroit where we competed with 160 teams from all over the world.</p>
