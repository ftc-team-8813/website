  This is a basic battery voltage meter that we made to quickly test our batteries
  between competitions. It uses four op-amp comparators to turn on LEDs at specific
  (and customizable) voltage steps.

<p class="flow-text">
  We made this tool because we found that it's really annoying to check batteries
  on the robot. You have to plug the battery into the robot and then find the
  driver station phone to actually see the voltage, and when there's maybe ten
  minutes between each competition and a two-minute walk between the pits and the
  competition fields, you don't have much time to be checking all of the
  batteries this way. This meter is small and readily accessible so that you can
  check all of the batteries very quickly.

<h2>Make it Yourself</h2>
<p class="flow-text">
  You can find the files to make one of these yourself
  <a href="https://github.com/cdbbnnyCode/BattMeter">on GitHub</a>. This is an
  open project, so feel free to make suggestions for improvements!
</p>
<p class="flow-text">
  Just <b>note that this <em>is</em> a soldering project, and if you don't
  know how to solder, you should probably practice on something less densely
  populated than this board.</b>
